# Work Experience & Projects

## LG Display, Paju, South Korea  
**Research Engineer, SC Medium OLED Big Data Analysis Task**  
**June 2021 – Present**

- Utilized Python, R, and SQL to analyze large datasets and generate actionable insights for the production team.
- Developed and implemented statistical and machine learning algorithms to identify and analyze the root causes of defects in the manufacturing process, leading to significant improvements in yield rates.
- Designed and deployed a real-time monitoring system to detect anomalies in production, enhancing operational efficiency.

### Key Projects:
1. **Image Analysis for Defect Detection Enhancement (Sep 2024 - Present)**  
   - Improved inspection logic and optimized detection efficiency by analyzing PTN images.  
   - Used Denoising Autoencoder to restore low-quality images and enhance detection accuracy.

2. **AI-based Defect Analysis (June 2021 - Sep 2024)**  
   - Performed time-series analysis on various factors including FDC, environmental, and process data.  
   - Developed analysis algorithms using techniques like XGBoost, LightGBM, SHAP, and statistical methods (ANOVA, correlation coefficients, EMA).

3. **Statistical Map Control System Development (Oct 2022 - Aug 2023)**  
   - Developed an algorithm to detect map shifts using image segmentation.  
   - Created statistical validation and machine learning-based algorithms to identify defective equipment.  
   - Defined system development requirements with process engineers, inspectors, and IT developers; wrote SQL queries for data extraction and analysis.

4. **Data Intelligence (Oct 2022 - Aug 2023)**  
   - Developed a mapping methodology using visual formats to verify CTQ (Critical to Quality) data.  
   - Built an API to handle large volumes of data and optimize data extraction.  
   - Standardized data visualization code and used BERT models to analyze differences in processing names across factories, automatically assigning standard names for new setups.
